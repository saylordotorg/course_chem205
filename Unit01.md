**Unit 1: Mass Spectrometry** <span id="1"></span> 
*Mass spectrometry* *(MS) is an analytical technique that is used to
determine the masses of particles for the elucidation of the chemical
structures of molecules.  The technique has
both* *qualitative* *and* *quantitative* *uses, including identifying
unknown compounds, determining the* *isotopic* *composition of elements
in a molecule, and revealing the* *structure* *of a compound by
observing its fragmentation.*  
  
 *This unit begins with a general discussion of the theory and
instrumentation of mass spectrometers.  A section on ionization and
detection methods is included.  The unit continues with a discussion of
isotopic distributions and fragmentation patterns of organic molecules. 
This unit concludes with application of these principles for structure
determination.*
