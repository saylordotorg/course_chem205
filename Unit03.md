**Unit 3: Infrared Spectroscopy** <span id="3"></span> 
*Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a* *spectroscopic technique* *that deals
with the* *infrared* *region of the* *electromagnetic spectrum.  The
spectra arise from vibrational and rotational states of excited
molecules.  IR spectroscopy can be used to identify compounds and
investigate sample compositions.*  
  
 *This unit begins with discussion of the general principles and the
instrumentation of IR spectroscopy.  It continues with information on
vibrational and rotational modes of molecules, followed by an
explanation of how Hooke’s Law, which is generally applied to springs in
physics courses, can be used to describe the motions of molecular
bonds.  The unit continues with details of spectral interpretation of
organic molecules and concludes with a discussion of other applications.
