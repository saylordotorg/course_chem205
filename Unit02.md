**Unit 2: Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy** <span id="2"></span> 
*Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) refers to* *absorption
spectroscopy* *in the ultraviolet-visibleregion of the electromagnetic
spectrum.  In this region of the electromagnetic spectrum,
molecules* *undergo* *electronic transitions, where electrons move from
a lower energy orbital (ground state) to one of higher energy (excited
state).  The nature of the electronic transition determines the nature
of the spectra produced.*  
  
 *This unit begins with a discussion of electromagnetic radiation and
spectroscopy, followed by the theory of UV-Vis spectroscopy.  The course
continues with a discussion of types of electronic transitions and a
brief review of how UV-Vis is used for analytical methods.  The unit
concludes with methods of empirically determining absorption wavelengths
based on structural implications.     *

     Instructions: Click on the “UV/Vis” button on the left-hand side of

    Absorptions of Simple Isolated Chromophores.”  This table lists the
    types of transitions, approximate absorption wavelengths, and
    relative absorptivities of various types of compounds.  Please note
    the influence of increased conjugation on the absorption
    wavelengths.  Conjugation is the overlap of one p-orbital with
    another across an intervening sigma bond.  A conjugated system has a
    region of alternating single and double bonds.  The pi electrons do
    not belong to a single bond or atom, but rather to a group of
    atoms.  The system allows a delocalization of electrons across all
    the adjacent aligned p-orbitals, which in general may lower the
    overall energy (increasing the absorption wavelength) of the
    molecule and increase stability.
