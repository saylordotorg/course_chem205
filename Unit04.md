**Unit 4: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) is a
technique that exploits the magnetic properties of certain nuclei. 
Elements containing an odd number of protons and/or neutrons within
their nucleus have an intrinsic magnetic moment; in other words, their
spin is not zero. Nuclei with even numbers of protons and/or neutrons
have a spin of zero.  In principle, NMR is applicable to any nucleus
possessing* *spin.  Quite a bit of information can be obtained from an
NMR spectrum, including the number and types of functional groups in a
molecule.  The most important applications for the organic chemist
are* *proton (<sup>1</sup>H) NMR* *and* *carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C)
NMR* *spectroscopy.   *  
  
 *NMR spectroscopy has had a huge impact on the natural sciences.  The
most popular application of NMR is known by the name of Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI).  An MRI is principally used for medical
diagnostics, but it can also be used to elucidate the structure of
analytes, illustrate how temperature affects chemical reactions, and
determine reaction mechanisms.  It is an invaluable tool for those
seeking to understand protein and nucleic acid structure and
function.*  
  
 *This unit begins with a discussion of the theory and instrumentation
of NMR spectrometers and how they manipulate magnetic fields to obtain
structural information of compounds.  Chemical shifts, spin-spin
interactions (coupling), and isomer effects will be discussed.  The unit
continues with a section specifically devoted to proton (<sup>1</sup>H) 
NMR, followed by a section on carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C) NMR.  Advanced
NMR techniques are also covered.  The unit concludes with several
opportunities to enhance your spectroscopic proficiency, combining all
spectra from all spectroscopic methods covered in this course.   *
